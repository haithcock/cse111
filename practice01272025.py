If a is 1 and B is 2 it should return 2 or print 2.
If a is "49" and b is "55" it should return 2695 or print 2695
If a is "5" and b is "5" it should return 25 or print 25



we will calculate 48*55, 43*43, and 5*5 

say we have a function called lolaneck(hair, yeast)

When hair = 400
and yeast = 60

we expect the function to return 9000

assert lolaneck(400, 60) == 9000
